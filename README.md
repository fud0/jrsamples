JasperReports Samples
=========

This repository maintains a collection of JasperReports projects.
A JasperReports project is a project that can be created inside Jaspersoft Studio Community Edition or Professional.
It is used to maintain a collection of resources like reports (JRXML files), data adapters, libraries, font extensions, source code and more.
All these items can be used inside Jaspersoft Studio itself or in a JasperReports Server based environment.
